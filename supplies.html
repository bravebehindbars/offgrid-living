	<li> The first thing needed is are knives.A large knife will be needed for hacking and protection. Next a small knife 
	 for day to day operations. As well you will need a skinning blade (we will discuss this in the hunting section) .</li>
	 a

	 <li>FIRE STARTER- KonvoySG Carbon Steel Fire Striker. A very good choice.<a href="http://konvoysg.com"> Visit Konvoysg.com 
	 </a>  </li>

	 <li>SHELTER- I recommend a good all around tent,known as a "hot tent". "Hot tents" have provisions for a wood stove. This should suffice until a permanent shelter is built.</li>

	 <li>Wood processing- Chainsaws are great, however they need,fuel,mix oil/bar oil. They need to be sharpened,and spare chains. I recommend an axe to start with.</li>

	 <li>PACKS- Any number of packs will do. Make sure it fits everything. Packs with metal frames make for even load distribution.
	 </li>

	 <li>SLED/CART- If you are walking into the woods.</li>
	 <li>SLEEPING- mats are great ,for long term I would recommend both a cot and a mat. Now your  sleeping bag matters,based on weather. Also a blanket will come in handy.</li>

	 <li>FOOD- Non-perishable food is the best for the start,until you get settled in. "M.R.E.'s may not taste the best, but they will help you survive.</li>
